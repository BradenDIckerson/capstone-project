    <h2>History</h2>
    <h3>Old Man Joe's Wandering Buffet was the brain child of (of course) an old man named Joe. Nobody know how or when he converted his van into a mobile Buffet, however it quickly gained popularity within the redneck and hil-billy communities around the area where he lived. Early in his career Joe's menu was pretty basic and mostly made up of whatever he could catch in the woods that day (or whatever people brought to him). More recent establishments have updated menu's to fit modern culture, except for Old Joe and his van... There still out there somewhere... </h3>
